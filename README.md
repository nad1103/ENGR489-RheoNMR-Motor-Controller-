# Introduction
The study of rheology using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) methods and techniques was an area pioneered by the late Professor Sir Paul Callaghan  and he came up with the phrase “Rheo-NMR”. Rheo-NMR describes a wide range of NMR methods used to measure the response of material to external mechanical stimuli. Traditionally, rheology is an area of science that mainly focuses on measuring the mechanical properties of matter. NMR enriches rheological studies as it has proven particularly useful for measuring the microscopic molecular states of complex material and can relate this information to the macroscopic mechanical properties under investigation .

To perform a Rheo-NMR experiment in a commercial NMR spectrometer, a Rheo-NMR accessory is needed. This accessory creates the essential rheological environments for the material under study, allowing an extensive range of samples and behaviour to be measured. The Bruker Rheo-NMR system contains everything required to immediately perform Rheo-NMR experiments with a Bruker NMR spectrometer. Although the system is distributed by Bruker, it is actually designed, manufactured and supported by Viclink.

The Rheo-NMR systems includes:

•	Rheo-NMR Controller

•	Motor & Drive-shaft

•	Shear Cell Kit

For this project, our focus is the Rheo-NMR controller. This controller drives the motor at the required rate and can accept signals from a range of sources, such as the spectrometer. Thus, the Rheo-NMR system can be driven directly from the spectrometer’s pulse programs.
